# Non-Counter Data Processing Application

## Backend

Dependencies are managed using [`uv`](https://lithic.tech/uv).\
They are listed in `pyproject.toml`.

The backend is **FastAPI** server, which can be launched using ```uv fastapi run```.\
The backend expects `.env` file with environment variables (**OPENAI_API_KEY**, **BRAIN_TOKEN**).
This will start the server on `127.0.0.1:8000`.
The autogenerated FastAPI docs are on `127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### Structure
The entrypoint to the backend is `main.py`.
The most important base classes and runtime are located in `base.py`.
The specialized agents and data states can be found in `models.py` and `workers.py`.

### Prompts
The prompt templates are written using [`Jinja`](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) templating.\
They are located in the `prompts/` directory and `prompts.py` is responsible for rendering the templates into final prompt strings.

## Frontend
Dependencies are managed using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/).\
To install dependencies, run: `npm install`.

Frontend is wrriten in **Vue**, using Primevue extension. To launch the app on localhost, use `npm run dev`.
